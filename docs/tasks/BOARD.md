# Task Board

Derived view over every dossier under `docs/tasks/` that is not
`implemented`/`superseded`/`abandoned`, grouped by `depends_on` + `status` per the rules
in `README.md`. If this file and a dossier's own frontmatter disagree, the frontmatter
wins — this is a cache, not a second source of truth. Maintained by `/spec` (adds a row
on dossier creation) and `/build` (moves a row on every status change).

Backfilled 2026-07-20 for the dossiers active at that date; the other ~80 dossiers under
`docs/tasks/` were already `implemented`/`superseded` and are intentionally not listed
here (see README.md's Dependencies and sequencing section for why untouched history
doesn't need a `depends_on` backfill).

## Ready now

Nothing blocking; these can start in any order relative to each other, including in
parallel.

- `2026-08-08-creative-thinking-course-example` (feature, draft) — `depends_on: []`. Adds a
  first-party `filled_count` in-process validator (open-ended activities currently have no
  correct validator kind), the first production activity plugin (a `mandala-9grid` renderer),
  an idempotent `smap.examples` seeder, and `docs/examples/creative-thinking-course.md`. Touches
  `backend/app/plugins/activity_validators.py`, `backend/smap/examples/` (new),
  `frontend/src/slices/activities/{types,components,plugins,locales}`. No migration, no API
  contract change. Verified no overlap with the other rows below.
- `2026-07-07-graphrag-two-axis-redesign` (feature, approved) — `depends_on: []`. This is
  a blueprint dossier: approval authorizes the target design, and its phases are meant to
  become separate `/build` dossiers (see its own §1). Open question: `docs/tasks/2026-07-07-graphrag-phase0..4b-*`
  already exist and are all `status: implemented` with overlapping `[Rxx.yy]` coverage —
  worth confirming with the user whether this blueprint's remaining scope is still live or
  its status is simply stale, before treating it as unblocked work.

## Blocked


## In progress

- `2026-07-19-large-artifacts-silently-dropped` (bugfix) — `depends_on: []`.
Removed on 2026-08-01 after implementation: `2026-07-22-wait-for-event-timer-and-join-ports`
(timer waits now arm their own `delay_seconds` via `workflow_event_resume`; the join
`timeout` port's absence is recorded via linter advisory + docs rather than built, per Q-2).
Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked.
Removed on 2026-08-01 after implementation: `2026-07-22-turn-outcome-reporting` (C2 and C3's
frontend-only slices on 2026-07-31, then C1, C4 and C3's backend half once
`turn-idempotency-and-locking` released `turn_engine.py`). Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no
row moved out of Blocked. Two things it leaves behind that a later reader will want: **FU-10** —
`_post_commit` catches `Exception`, so a *cancellation* in the post-commit window still rewrites a
committed turn as failed; the fix belongs with `_finalize_failed_turn`, which
`turn-idempotency-and-locking` owns. **FU-11** — `agent.progress` beacons cover the gaps between
assembly steps, not a single provider call that outlasts the 120s watchdog. It also closes
`chatroom-socket-lifecycle`'s FU-8, which had been waiting on this dossier's C3.
Removed on 2026-08-01 after implementation: `2026-07-22-workflow-capability-enforcement`
(can_approve/can_instruct gated at runtime, advisory linter + picker markers, max_alive_subagents
bounds, migration 0073 applied and downgrade-checked). Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no
row moved out of Blocked.
Removed on 2026-07-31 after implementation: `2026-07-22-turn-idempotency-and-locking` (all six
commits C1–C6, migration 0072 applied and downgrade-checked). Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so
no row moved out of Blocked. It does unblock `2026-07-22-turn-outcome-reporting`'s backend half:
that dossier's D-1 deferred C1/C3/C4 because `turn_engine.py` was being rebuilt here, and that
rebuild is now committed. Re-verify its citations before resuming — this work restructured
`run_turn` (the lock loop is wrapped in a `try/finally` that drains the coalesced trigger), split
`_run_locked`'s failure handling into a shared `_finalize_failed_turn` with a third `except` arm
for a lost lock, and changed `distributed_lock` to yield a `LockHandle` instead of a bool.

Removed on 2026-07-28 because their own frontmatter reads `implemented` and the board only
lists unfinished work: `2026-07-22-activity-session-authz-and-validation`,
`2026-07-22-workflow-run-cancellation`, `2026-07-28-activity-schema-participant-access`.
Also removed on 2026-07-29 after implementation: `2026-07-22-reingest-allowlist-propagation`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-ingest-concurrency-and-enqueue`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-upload-resource-bounds`, `2026-07-29-knowledge-ingest-ports`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-document-ui-split`, and `2026-07-22-retention-sweep-fixes`.
Removed on 2026-07-29 after implementation: `2026-07-22-search-determinism-and-highlighting`.
Removed on 2026-07-30 after implementation: `2026-07-22-settings-form-reconciliation`. Nothing
listed it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked.
Removed on 2026-07-31 after implementation: `2026-07-22-tool-dispatch-failure-categories`.
Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked. It does change the ground
under `2026-07-22-turn-idempotency-and-locking`, which names it as a textual adjacency: this
work restructured `_stream_with_tools` (the tool-round loop is now a bounded `for` over
attempts with its own round counter, and the function returns `ToolLoopOutcome` instead of
`tuple[str, int]`), so that dossier's citations into the turn loop need re-verifying before
it starts.
Removed on 2026-07-30 after implementation: `2026-07-22-subagent-spawn-fail-fast`. Nothing listed
it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked. It does validate two standing assumptions in
`2026-07-22-workflow-capability-enforcement`: `SubagentService.spawn` now has **zero** production
callers, so that dossier's Q-2 (no runtime gate for `can_create_subagent`) and its R6 (zero file
overlap) both hold as written.
