# Task Board

Derived view over every dossier under `docs/tasks/` that is not
`implemented`/`superseded`/`abandoned`, grouped by `depends_on` + `status` per the rules
in `README.md`. If this file and a dossier's own frontmatter disagree, the frontmatter
wins — this is a cache, not a second source of truth. Maintained by `/spec` (adds a row
on dossier creation) and `/build` (moves a row on every status change).

Backfilled 2026-07-20 for the dossiers active at that date; the other ~80 dossiers under
`docs/tasks/` were already `implemented`/`superseded` and are intentionally not listed
here (see README.md's Dependencies and sequencing section for why untouched history
doesn't need a `depends_on` backfill).

## Ready now

Nothing blocking; these can start in any order relative to each other, including in
parallel.

- `2026-07-22-wait-for-event-timer-and-join-ports` (bugfix, draft) — `depends_on: []`. a2a F-2,
  F-36: a `timer` wait — the editor's seeded default — parks until its timeout and exits the
  failure port, and the join `timeout` port is documented, linted, rendered and produced by
  nothing. **Q-2 open**: build the join timeout or record its absence. If the user chooses to
  build it, `depends_on` becomes `[2026-07-22-join-epoch-loop-reentry]` (its Q-3).
- `2026-07-07-graphrag-two-axis-redesign` (feature, approved) — `depends_on: []`. This is
  a blueprint dossier: approval authorizes the target design, and its phases are meant to
  become separate `/build` dossiers (see its own §1). Open question: `docs/tasks/2026-07-07-graphrag-phase0..4b-*`
  already exist and are all `status: implemented` with overlapping `[Rxx.yy]` coverage —
  worth confirming with the user whether this blueprint's remaining scope is still live or
  its status is simply stale, before treating it as unblocked work.

## Blocked


## In progress

- `2026-07-19-large-artifacts-silently-dropped` (bugfix) — `depends_on: []`.
- `2026-07-22-turn-outcome-reporting` (bugfix) — `depends_on: []`. Approved 2026-07-31; SRS delta
  applied as `[R13.27]`. a2u F-6, F-9, F-15 plus a2a F-40. A committed reply is recorded as a failed
  turn when the post-commit publish raises. **Partially built: C2 only.** C1/C3/C4 all edit
  `turn_engine.py`, which `2026-07-22-turn-idempotency-and-locking` is concurrently rebuilding, so
  the backend half is deferred until that dossier finishes — see this dossier's D-1 and FU-7.
  **STILL PRIORITISE — its C3 was meant to merge before or with `chatroom-socket-lifecycle`, which
  landed first on 2026-07-24.** F-15 is therefore unmasked: the socket churn used to cancel the
  client thinking-watchdog on every reconnect, so a pre-stream assembly window over 120s now
  reports a healthy turn as `timeout` every time instead of intermittently. See that dossier's
  FU-8.
Removed on 2026-08-01 after implementation: `2026-07-22-workflow-capability-enforcement`
(can_approve/can_instruct gated at runtime, advisory linter + picker markers, max_alive_subagents
bounds, migration 0073 applied and downgrade-checked). Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no
row moved out of Blocked.
Removed on 2026-07-31 after implementation: `2026-07-22-turn-idempotency-and-locking` (all six
commits C1–C6, migration 0072 applied and downgrade-checked). Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so
no row moved out of Blocked. It does unblock `2026-07-22-turn-outcome-reporting`'s backend half:
that dossier's D-1 deferred C1/C3/C4 because `turn_engine.py` was being rebuilt here, and that
rebuild is now committed. Re-verify its citations before resuming — this work restructured
`run_turn` (the lock loop is wrapped in a `try/finally` that drains the coalesced trigger), split
`_run_locked`'s failure handling into a shared `_finalize_failed_turn` with a third `except` arm
for a lost lock, and changed `distributed_lock` to yield a `LockHandle` instead of a bool.

Removed on 2026-07-28 because their own frontmatter reads `implemented` and the board only
lists unfinished work: `2026-07-22-activity-session-authz-and-validation`,
`2026-07-22-workflow-run-cancellation`, `2026-07-28-activity-schema-participant-access`.
Also removed on 2026-07-29 after implementation: `2026-07-22-reingest-allowlist-propagation`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-ingest-concurrency-and-enqueue`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-upload-resource-bounds`, `2026-07-29-knowledge-ingest-ports`,
`2026-07-29-knowledge-document-ui-split`, and `2026-07-22-retention-sweep-fixes`.
Removed on 2026-07-29 after implementation: `2026-07-22-search-determinism-and-highlighting`.
Removed on 2026-07-30 after implementation: `2026-07-22-settings-form-reconciliation`. Nothing
listed it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked.
Removed on 2026-07-31 after implementation: `2026-07-22-tool-dispatch-failure-categories`.
Nothing lists it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked. It does change the ground
under `2026-07-22-turn-idempotency-and-locking`, which names it as a textual adjacency: this
work restructured `_stream_with_tools` (the tool-round loop is now a bounded `for` over
attempts with its own round counter, and the function returns `ToolLoopOutcome` instead of
`tuple[str, int]`), so that dossier's citations into the turn loop need re-verifying before
it starts.
Removed on 2026-07-30 after implementation: `2026-07-22-subagent-spawn-fail-fast`. Nothing listed
it in `depends_on`, so no row moved out of Blocked. It does validate two standing assumptions in
`2026-07-22-workflow-capability-enforcement`: `SubagentService.spawn` now has **zero** production
callers, so that dossier's Q-2 (no runtime gate for `can_create_subagent`) and its R6 (zero file
overlap) both hold as written.
